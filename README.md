# A Statistical Representation of Traffic Volume for a Specific Station per Time
*CS 159.32: Data Visualization Final Project by Francis Bautista and Eyana Mallari*

This project works to use historical high-medium-low data collated by the MMDA and Dr. Reina Reyes to give a statistical representation of the traffic volume for a specific station for a given line at a certain time. It will use a pie-chart to represent the statistical breakdown of the chances for the traffic volumes.
